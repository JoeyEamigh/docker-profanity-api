# What is this?

This is a very simple docker container which launches an HTTP GET endpoint on port 8000 that will return whether or not it thinks a string is profane. It uses two python libraries to determine whether it is profane. It is not perfect by any means, but hey - better than most solutions I could find.

## How to run:

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```
